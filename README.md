# IT.Quest

IT.Quest primarily addresses the need for a system designed for examining students with specific features tailored for IT classes. It allows teachers to create single exercises of different types, combine them into problem sets, produce many assignments, pop quizzes, or tests restricted by time, review and grade users' answers, and export results to other media.

The application supports three types of exercises: normal, true / false, and programming. Moreover, their content can be formatted using an advanced text editor that allows for changes in font size, color, or style, usage of tables or images, and other features like writing code. Each exercise also includes a number of points, hashtags, and the type of answer.

Problem sets could be reused many times for different assignments for several classes. The teacher can create as many sessions with distinct dates from one set as he wants. After the session finishes, each student's result is marked as not graded yet. The status of each educatee's work updates automatically when the teacher grades it. As a result, it shows the tutor which answers have to be graded, which are partially graded, and which are ready to go.

Additionally, the application allows for sending files, writing the code in the browser, or attaching it from the file. On top of that, it provides the teacher with an option to specify which programming language is required for a given exercise. Therefore, assignments involving databases or solving certain coding problems can be smoothly conducted through this system.
